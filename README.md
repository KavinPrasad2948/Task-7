# TASK 7

###  Fetching Data
The code uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object to fetch data from the REST Countries API.

###  Parsing JSON
It then parses the JSON response and stores it in the `data` variable.

###  Filtering Countries from Asia
It filters the countries from the Asia continent/region using the `filter` function and logs their names.

###  Filtering Countries with Less Population
It filters the countries with a population of less than 2 lakhs using the `filter` function and logs their names.

###  Iterating Through Data
It iterates through the `data` array using the `forEach` function and logs the name, capital, and flag of each country.

###  Calculating Total Population
It calculates the total population of all countries using the `reduce` function and logs the result.

###  Filtering Countries with US Dollars as Currency
It filters the countries that use US dollars as currency using the `filter` function, sorts them alphabetically by their common name, and logs their names.

This code demonstrates the use of various array functions such as `filter`, `forEach`, `reduce`, and `sort` to manipulate and extract information from an array of objects representing countries.
